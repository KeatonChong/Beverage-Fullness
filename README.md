# Beverage-Fullness

The goal of this project is to verify the fullness of a beverage in a glass.
An expanded version of this project could be greatly beneficial to quickly determining fast and precise measurements of required liquids without issue, which could be useful for scientific research or medical treatments. 
In order to reproduce this project with the necessary materials/resources, use the code provided to create the display interactive tool where you can train your model.
Create the datasets and categories based on what beverages you have available. 
Train the model properly by using the USB/CSI camera and the display interactive tool, and after running all of the code, the model should function correctly.
Save the fully trained model, and the model is complete!
